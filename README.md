# Project6_MNIST
Model to predict the character in MNIST data set 

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset from handwritten images.

Introduction:

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. A new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike. In this project,the goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks.

Libraries Involved:

1. Numpy 
2. Pandas 
3. Seaborn 
4. Matplotlib 
5. Pydot 
6. Graphviz 
7. Sklearn 
8. Keras 

Steps Involved:

1. Import package 
2. Load the MNIST Dataset 
3. CNN 
4. Evaluate the model 
5. Prediction validation 

Conclusion: 

Using the neural network on the MNIST Dataset,we are uble to predict the digit in images with 99% accuracy.
